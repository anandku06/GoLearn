# Go Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my **Go Learning Journey**! This repository documents my progress as I explore the **Go (Golang) programming language**. I will be adding code snippets, projects, notes, and solutions to various challenges I encounter along the way.

## 📌 About This Repository

This repository serves as a **learning log** where I experiment with Go concepts, build small projects, and apply Go to real-world problems. It includes:

- 📂 **Beginner Exercises** – Basic syntax, data structures, and functions
- ⚙️ **Go Projects** – Mini-projects to solidify my understanding
- 📜 **Notes & Resources** – Key takeaways from my learning journey
- 🏆 **Challenges & Solutions** – Problems I solve while learning

## 🚀 Getting Started

If you'd like to follow along or contribute, here’s how you can get started:

### **1️⃣ Install Go**

If you haven’t installed Go yet, follow these steps:

```bash
wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.24.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.24.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

Then add Go to your PATH:

```bash
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Verify installation:

```bash
go version
```

### **2️⃣ Clone This Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anandku06/go-learning-journey.git
cd go-learning-journey
```

### **3️⃣ Run a Sample Go Program**

Create a simple **Hello, World!** program:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, Go!")
}
```

Run it:

```bash
go run main.go
```
